# burgers

This app represents the self-service ordering station for Get-da-Burger. I've created the optional  Sequelize-version of this app in lieu of the required Handlebars-version.

The user simply inputs their order into the input field, which will return a string, and then clicks the submit button.

The user's order will be prepared, and will display below the input field. The prepared order will display a message stating that the user's order is ready to be eat. Once the user is ready to eat, he or she can click the "Devour it!" button included below this message. The order will disappear, and be replaced with a message stating that the order has "been devoured."
